INSTAGRAM MEDIA SCHEDULER SaaS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

This is my first Software as a Service app that im building using Flask and Python.
Saas is sofware provided over the internet. It is neither downloaded nor owned by the user.
Saas consists of many parts:
      1: front-end(website or app) that the user interacts with.
      2: back-end that handles data and provides the front-end with its needs.
      3: A data base for data storage.
      4: An existing problem and its solution.

There are many Social media schedulers around but theyre not great. The goal is to capture a small slice of the market and build a product or feature that is better than what is out there, price cheaply than the competitors and have a simpler product overall.

KNOW WHAT YOUR COMPETITORS OFFER:
    1: The best features to start with are those users use the most or the ones users/clients mostly ask for.
    2: If your competitors are long standing companies, it is likely they have product problems e.g. ugly UI, expensive feature or missing feature that they havent incorporated yet.#
    3: Offer a single feature or offering, make it better than your competitors and price it cheaply.

  
  TECHNOLOGIES WE NEED TO CREATE THE INSTAGRAM SaaS APP!!!!!!!
      1: Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript
      2: Instagram API
      3: PostgreSQL for storing info about each post and user.
      4: B2 Backblaze for storing the images we want to post.
      5: Celery for running the background tasks that do the publishing.
